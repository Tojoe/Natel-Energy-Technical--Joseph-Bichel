Through overlaying the turbine head and shaft power with respect to time we can see that as hight increases the power increases. 
This makes sense, more height more potential energy converted to become kenetic energy to push the turbine. The "steps" formed 
on the shaft power vs. time graph can be explained through the nozzle position. The more the nozzle is out of position less power 
is produced. It looks as if the the tests was taken, by placing the head at 2.5m, 3.5m and 4m and taking various nozzle positioning 
at each distance at similar time intervals.
